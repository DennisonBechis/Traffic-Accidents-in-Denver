# Automobile Accidents in Denver
**JOHN HERR | Proposal for Capstone 1**

## Background

Globally, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for persons aged 5-29 years according to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries). While improvements in automobile safety have greatly reduced the dangers of driving, more than 32,000 people are killed and 2 million are injured each year from motor vehicle crashes in the US alone each year according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/motor-vehicle-safety/index.html).


## Question
Where are automobile accidents most likely to occur in the city of Denver? What are the most dangerous intersections/roads? What factors are correlated with an increased rate of automobile accidents?

## Data

The Denver Open Data Catalog has [a dataset](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-traffic-accidents)  that includes motor vehicle crashes reported to the Denver Police Department, that occurred within the City and County of Denver and during the previous five calendar years.  The dataset records over 156,000 incidents with 45 columns which provide information including the geographic locations, the road conditions, the determined cause of the accidents, injuries/fatalities that that resulted from the accident.

### MVP
* Provide data visualizations of traffic accidents in Denver over the past five years.  Are traffic accidents increasing with an increase in the population of Denver?
* Identify the roads/intersections with the highest rate of accidents
* Determine correlations between traffic accidents and the season, the time of day, the road conditions.

### MVP++
* Determine the most dangerous roads/intersectiosn by normalizing based on traffic volume using Denverâ€™s [traffic count dataset](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-traffic-counts)
* Determine whether distributions of specific types of accidents (e.g., DUIs, and hit-and-runs)
* Are [traffic cameras](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-intelligent-traffic-system-devices) strategically placed at roads/intersections with the highest rate of accidents?
* Are [bike lanes](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-denver-bicycle-facilities) reducing traffic accidents involving bicyclists after they are installed
* How safe are Denver roads compared to the US nationally?
